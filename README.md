- Modern and intuitive design
- Demonstration of best practices in organizing HTML, CSS code, and possible integrations with JavaScript for interactive functionalities.

## Technology

The following are the key technologies and tools used in the development of this app:

- **HTML/SCSS**: Used for structuring and styling the page.
- **Grid**: Set the elements as a grid container.
- **Flexbox**: Set the elements as a flexbox container.
- **Icomoon**: A platform where you can create icon packs, and use icons as fonts.
